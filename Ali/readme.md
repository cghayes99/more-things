### mapster

Here is a Juyter Notebook file that you take a look that does a Google Map API search.  It uses their Places API with a text search.  An example URL looks like this:

`https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/textsearch/json?query=Ben%20and%20Jerry%27s+in+MO&key={api_key}`

The script will output the results into a CSV file.  An example of one is there as well.

There is also a Python flavor too.  I included the data file that created the other day just in case.  It is in the `data-files` folder.
